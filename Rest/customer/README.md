A **single data import/evaluation request** handles one customer data entry at a time, enabling real-time validation, analysis, or customization. This approach is suitable when data is updated frequently, or individual entries require specific handling, such as during a live data capture or when processing high-priority information.

**Batch data import only requests**, on the other hand, involve processing large volumes of customer data at once, typically on a scheduled basis. Batch processing is efficient for handling high-volume data updates, like bulk customer onboarding, periodic data cleaning, or historical data import. By running in batches, it reduces the load on system resources, ensures consistency, and allows for more robust error handling and validation.

Using single or batch methods strategically enables organizations to balance real-time data needs with high-volume processing, enhancing both data accuracy and operational efficiency in customer management.
