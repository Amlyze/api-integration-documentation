# api-integration-documentation

## Welcome

AMLYZE is SaaS, which integrated will allow and help you with:
* Risk Assessment on new and existing clients;
* Transaction monitoring and analysis of suspicious financial transactions;
* Screening (Sanctions, PEPs, Adverse media);
* Reconcile previous request data and retrieve classifier values.

---
In order to integrate - many steps must be done, therefore we will try to ease that with the help of API documentation.

---

Currently two `SOAP/REST` API integrations are offered. 

---
Please note that the `SOAP API is deprecated`. It is recommended to migrate to newer alternative such as REST API.

---


* [REST API](Rest/README.md)

* [SOAP API](Soap/README.md)
